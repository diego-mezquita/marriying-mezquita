  <p>Why Ireland?</p>
  <p>Itâ€™s no secret that we are both crazy about traveling and discovering new places so planning a destination wedding was a no brainer.</p>
  <p>So, why Ireland? Our very first trip together was to Ireland. Holly has a few friends that live in the west and I had wanted to go somewhere to study English so we found a course for me to attend in Dublin and at the end of the course Holly came to visit me.</p>
  <p>While we were busy falling for each other, we also fell in love with Ireland. There is just something so magical and special about it. Everyone you meet is friendly, the countryside and the coast are beautiful, and you can find live music just about everywhere you go.</p>
