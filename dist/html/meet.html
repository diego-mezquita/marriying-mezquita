<div class="lightbox__text"><p>How we met</p><p>It was my (Holly’s) 2nd interview with the CEO of the company. I couldn’t have been any more nervous, and to make matters worse, my future boss had accidentally sent me the address to the wrong office. I frantically called around trying to figure out where I needed to be so I could get to the interview on time.</p><p>I finally found my way into a small office by the beach. Everyone was completely silent and staring my way when I walked in. I felt like I had just burst in on them, but what I thought at the time was a sweet little nerd, hopped up immediately to greet me with the biggest smile.</p><p>Before I let him speak I told him my situation, in Spanish, asking if the man I was going to have my interview with worked in this office or not. Funny enough, he answered me in English (was my Spanish really that bad?) letting me know that I had made it.</p><p>The boss came out from the back room jokingly telling everyone I had just passed my first test. And just a few short hours after the interview, I received a formal offer to join the team. I was just as excited (well, a bit nervous too) about the job as I was about seeing Diego again!</p></div>
