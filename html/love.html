<div class="lightbox__text"><p>How we started dating</p><p>It all started at the water tank. Well, sort of. We spent months and months slowly getting to know each other, mostly smiling at each other and finding excuses here and there to talk.</p><p>It wasn’t until we decided to grab a drink together after a long week at work that things really began. I don’t think either of us were really considering our first date to be an actual date or at least not in the beginning. We were both cautious, but after hours of getting lost in conversation, we quickly realized things felt right and from that point on we were inseparable.</p></div>
